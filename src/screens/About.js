            Code Your Chances (CYC) is a nonprofit organization that introduces young girls to the creative uses of computer science and how they can apply their unique creativity to tech. Our mission is to inspire a new generation of diverse leaders in computer science by focusing on how computer science is used in creative industries, such as film production, game development, AR, VR, and creative uses of AI. CYC works with communities that have limited access to tech education.</p>

        <p className='aboutInfoSmall' data-AOS="fade-up">So much of the world around us is run by technology. If women are not contributing to these systems and products, bias becomes imbedded in the algorithms, data sets and designs that influence our future.</p>
        <div className='aboutInfo NYTimes' data-AOS="fade-up">
          <p className='NYTimesData'>"Many artificial intelligence technologies, like face-recognition services and conversational systems, are designed to learn from large amounts of data, such as thousands of photos of faces. The biases of researchers can easily be introduced into the technology, reinforcing the importance of diversity among the people working on it."</p>
